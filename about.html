         <p>The Studio was founded in September 2018, under the name of KryptoPixels Designs Studio. Studio's first project was gamed called "Nation in Blood", which I've been working for a year before. It was really ambitious, but we took it. After not that long, we opened for contactas from abroad, which turned out to be profitable. Then there was a little crisis and the project was frozen. We returned as the Ethericall and started doing something else - "Monster Cells", which was even more ambitious, but too big and complicated for such a small Studio, so it was frozen too. After that we returned to the "Nation in Blood", it was quite promising, but one of our employes attacked the Studio, which closed everything. After many months we returned as the new Ethericall with new project - The Warsaw Metro Simulator, but it was closed due to too small niche. Right now we're working on new, and hopefully, final product - Fantasy RPG from isometric view.</p><br><a>~~Rein - CEO and Founder</a><br>&nbsp;
